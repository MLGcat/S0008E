\section*{Valgrind}
\subsection*{Memory leaks}

A total of 3 leaks were identified by valgrind:

==621== HEAP SUMMARY:
==621==     in use at exit: 200,604 bytes in 106 blocks
==621==   total heap usage: 116 allocs, 10 frees, 283,580 bytes allocated
==621== 
==621== 116 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 4 of 12
==621==    at 0x4838DEF: operator new(unsigned long) (vg_replace_malloc.c:344)
==621==    by 0x10AA27: PathTracer::PathTracer(int, int) (pathtracer.cpp:6)
==621==    by 0x10A67A: main (main.cpp:27)
==621== 
==621== 3,880 (32 direct, 3,848 indirect) bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 11 of 12
==621==    at 0x4838DEF: operator new(unsigned long) (vg_replace_malloc.c:344)
==621==    by 0x10AFC3: randomScene(unsigned int, bool) (pathtracer.cpp:46)
==621==    by 0x10B875: PathTracer::Render(unsigned int, unsigned int) (pathtracer.cpp:87)
==621==    by 0x10A690: main (main.cpp:28)
==621== 
==621== 196,608 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 12 of 12
==621==    at 0x483950F: operator new[](unsigned long) (vg_replace_malloc.c:433)
==621==    by 0x10AA9A: PathTracer::PathTracer(int, int) (pathtracer.cpp:7)
==621==    by 0x10A67A: main (main.cpp:27)

These came from the creation of the output buffer, camera and scene, which were not removed upon the destruction of the pathtracer.
